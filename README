** Irish Vaccine Telegram Bot ** 

Contains two different python scripts. 

One periodically queries the Irish Vaccine API, to pull down the latest stats and saves them in an sqlite DB called covid.db. 

The other sets up a Telegram bot, which provides a number of commands, including /daily, which subscribes the user to daily updates. 

The bot checks the database for updates, and updates people that have subscribed.
